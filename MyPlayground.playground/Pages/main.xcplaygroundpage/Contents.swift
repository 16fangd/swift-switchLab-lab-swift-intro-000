// First let's try some of last lab's questions but using a 'switch' instead of 'if' or 'if/else'.

// Given....
let x = 5.0
let y = 12
let a = 321
let b = 32


/*: Question 1
### 1. Print "true" if a modulo b is equal to zero
*/
// write your code here





/*: Question 2
### 2. Print "true" if y divided by x is greater than three, otherwise print false
*/
// write your code here





/*: Question 3
### 3. Print "true" if y is greater than x and a divided by b is grater than 9
*/
// write your code here




/*: Question 4
### 4. Write a function "isGreater" that takes two Int arguments and returns "yep" if a is greater than b and "nope" if they're not
*/
// write your code here






/*: Question 5
### 5. write a function "isForceWith" that takes a String argument and returns true if the argument is the name of some whom the force is strong with, otherwise it returns false
*/
// write your code here



/*: Question 6
### 6. write a function "isInRange" that takes an Int  argument and prints "small" if it's in the range of 0 and 3, "medium" if it's in the range of 4 and 6, "big" if it's in the range of 7 and 10, and otherwise prints "not sure".
