# Switch Lab



## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Feel comfortable producing various switch statements on their own.



## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double and Bool type.
* Work with if and else clauses.
* Knows how to make switch statements.

## Outline / Notes

*  I've included a playground file where we can formulate a list of questions that the student will answer. The first few questions should be easy that solidfy what it is they were just showed in the prior readme.
* Considering that they won't know too much, maybe it might be difficult to formulate a bunch of questions revolving around switch statements. Either way, getting them to type and work with the syntax over and over is important.
